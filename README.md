# Project SCH
## School Communication Hub

Project SCH (School Communication Hub) is a national digital platform designed to connect
schools, teachers, students, parents, and education authorities in a safe and organized way.

## Problem
Many schools rely on informal messaging platforms that are unsafe, unstructured,
and difficult to monitor. This creates misinformation, poor communication,
and weak coordination between schools and parents.

## Solution
Project SCH provides:
- Secure school-based communication
- Role-based access (Admin, Teacher, Student, Parent)
- Content approval for student safety
- Multi-school support
- National education visibility

## Users
- Ministry / Super Admin
- Headteachers (School Admin)
- Teachers
- Students
- Parents / Guardians

## Vision
To become the official digital communication backbone for schools,
supporting safe learning, accountability, and national education growth.

## Status
Project SCH is in early development (MVP stage).
